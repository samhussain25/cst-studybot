    "mistakes": "Many solutions failed to cover all special cases in pseudocode (empty tree, single element, single subtree, two subtrees but successor is a direct child of root). Common errors included failing to update all parent pointers, updating child pointers incorrectly leading to loops or multiple trees, and confusing 'explicit requirement' from part b) with BT2."

Incorrectly assumed page table access necessitates disk access, page table entry per byte, or equated smaller pages with more addresses. Confused paging hardware with software paging."

Not all relevant stakeholders were listed, or candidates misunderstood the app's function. Design principles proposed were too generic or from other courses. Discussed trade-offs were too generic, unrelated, or unrealistic."
